# Smart Parking System

## Problem Statement:

Inefficient parking systems contribute to urban congestion and inconvenience. This project addresses the need for a smart parking solution using machine learning to detect and verify vehicle license plates. The objective is to streamline parking processes, enhance user experience, and contribute to efficient urban parking management.

## Methodology:

The methodology for our smart parking system involves integrating license plate detection and ultrasonic sensor-based occupancy monitoring. After collecting and preprocessing datasets for compatibility, a pretrained deep learning model is fine-tuned to seamlessly integrate ultrasonic sensor data. The model's detection results are transmitted to the cloud, where an Arduino is coupled to receive instructions, facilitating real-time categorization of parking spaces. This integration links detected license plates to user profiles, distinguishing between faculty and student parking. The resulting prototype optimizes parking space utilization, providing a seamless and efficient parking experience through cloud-aided communication between the ML model and the Arduino-controlled system.
